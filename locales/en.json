	"History1": "Ecuador comes from the Spanish form ‘equator’ (which runs through it). In essence, all the colours, cultures, forms and nature are together all in one place.  This is the reason Ecuador should be one of the leading countries in the world when it comes to design. This beautiful country marks the middle of the world, and is therefore the center spot where all inspiration, knowledge and creativity should meet.  Ecuador is the centre magnet that drives all the energy and passion into one place.",
	"History2": "The Ecuador Poster Bienal was founded by Christopher Scott in the year 2015."
